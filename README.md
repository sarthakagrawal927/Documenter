pnpm i
yarn
npm i
```

To start server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

I have stopped this project because unpkg.com doesn't work the way it used to , it doesnt redirects to the main file of the package when you go to package instead it shows the directory of the package. Without it a you can't import any npm packages from this, essentially making this a in-browser js toolbox.

Things I learned new:

TS with Redux
LocalForage
ESbuild packager.
